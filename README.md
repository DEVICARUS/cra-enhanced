## Docs

### Generator

The generator is a simple script for creating new components (and other things) using the templates from the `templates` directory. Simply run `yarn run generator` to start using it.



**Currently supports**

- React Components

- React-Redux Containers

- Redux Reducers

- Redux Actions

### Proxying

API requests 'just work'. On the development server, `/api` is being forwarded to the `5000` port. This assumes your API dev server runs on this port and your production server serves the API and React both on the same port.
